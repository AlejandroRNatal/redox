# Summary

This project is just for fun and its aim is to Emulate a GBA for playing ROMs. The emulator is written in Rust as a way to learn proper Rust development/ architecting . This is just a scratchpad/throwaway project not meant to be criticized harshly rather as a neat learning tool.

## Architecture

- BIOS / Boot ROM

- Register File
  - RAM
   - IWRAM
   - VRAM
   - OAM
  - Registers
    - General Purpose Registers[15:0]
    - PC
    - SP (CPSR / SPSR)

- CPU
  - ALU
  - CU
  - Interrupts
    - Software
    - Hardware
  - Timer / Clock

- Controller
  -  Up ‚¨Ü
  -  Down ‚¨á
  -  Left ‚¨Ö
  -  Right ‚û°
  -  Start

- PPU
  - Screen
    - Width: 240 px
    - Height: 160 px
    - Refresh Rate: 60 Hz

- Instructions
  - ARM v4
    - Data Processing
    - Branch and Exchange
